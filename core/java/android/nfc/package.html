<BODY>
Provides access to Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality, allowing applications to read
NDEF message in NFC tags. A "tag" may actually be another device that appears as a tag.

<p>Here's a summary of the classes:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>{@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter}</dt>
  <dd>This represents the device's NFC adapter, which is your entry-point to performing NFC
operations. You can acquire an instance with {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#getDefaultAdapter}.</dd>
  <dt>{@link android.nfc.NdefMessage}</dt>
  <dd>Represents an NDEF data message, which is the standard format in which "records"
carrying data are transmitted between devices and tags. Your application can receive these
messages from an {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#ACTION_TAG_DISCOVERED} intent.</dd>
  <dt>{@link android.nfc.NdefRecord}</dt>
  <dd>Represents a record, which is delivered in a {@link android.nfc.NdefMessage} and describes the
type of data being shared and carries the data itself.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
Not all Android-powered devices provide NFC functionality.</p>
